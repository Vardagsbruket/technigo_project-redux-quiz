## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory. This project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The following command combines installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code, and starting a development server on your terminal:

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem
The team initiated the project by creating a Trello work plan and a Figma design. Tasks were distributed among team members based on mutual understanding.

The app is a multiple-choice quiz game with a focus on getting familiar with Redux. The theme revolves around Swedish-related general questions, and multiple choices are provided to the user. Each question has a timer, and when it runs out, the correct answer is displayed. The quiz itself has a timer, and at the end, the app reveals how long the user took to complete the quiz. Correct and incorrect questions are clearly marked. Pictures and gifs  are added for clarity and fun. The quiz concludes with a summary page displaying the score and details of correct and incorrect questions.
